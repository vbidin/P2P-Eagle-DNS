	 * <p>The reporting of parameter entities (including

	 * <code
	 * >http://xml.org/sax/features/lexical-handler/parameter-entities</code>
	 * feature to query or control the reporting of parameter entities.</p>
	 * <p/>
	 * <p>General entities are reported with their regular names,
	 * parameter entities have '%' prepended to their names, and
	 * the external DTD subset has the pseudo-entity name "[dtd]".</p>
	 * <p/>
	 * <p>When a SAX2 driver is providing these events, all other
	 * events must be properly nested within start/end entity
	 * events.  There is no additional requirement that events from
	 * {@link org.xml.sax.ext.DeclHandler DeclHandler} or
	 * {@link org.xml.sax.DTDHandler DTDHandler} be properly ordered.</p>
	 * <p/>
	 * <p>Note that skipped entities will be reported through the
	 * {@link org.xml.sax.ContentHandler#skippedEntity skippedEntity}
	 * event, which is part of the ContentHandler interface.</p>
	 * <p/>
	 * <p>Because of the streaming event model that SAX uses, some
	 * entity boundaries cannot be reported under any
	 * circumstances:</p>
	 * <p/>
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>general entities within attribute values</li>
	 * <li>parameter entities within declarations</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * <p/>

	 * the original entity boundaries were.</p>
	 * <p/>
	 * <p>Note also that the boundaries of character references (which
	 * are not really entities anyway) are not reported.</p>
	 * <p/>
	 * <p>All start/endEntity events must be properly nested.
	 *
	 * @param name The name of the entity.  If it is a parameter
	 *             entity, the name will begin with '%', and if it is the
